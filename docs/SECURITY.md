# Security Considerations

## Overview

StateForge implements multiple security layers to ensure safe state machine execution. This document outlines security features, potential risks, and best practices.

## Security Features

### 1. Access Control

**Implementation**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl

**Features**:
- Granular permissions per transition
- Role hierarchy support
- Admin role separation
- Batch role management

**Best Practices**:
- Use minimum necessary permissions
- Regularly audit role assignments
- Implement time-locked admin changes
- Use multisig for admin roles

### 2. Reentrancy Protection

**Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard on StateMachine

**Protected Functions**:
- `transitionTo()` - Main state transition function

**Additional Measures**:
- State updates before external calls
- Hook gas limits to prevent DoS
- Fail-safe hook execution (continue on hook failure)

### 3. Replay Protection

**Implementation**: Nonce-based transition tracking

**Features**:
- Monotonic nonce increment
- Actor address validation
- Timestamp recording

### 4. Validation Layers

**Multiple Checkpoints**:
1. Structural validation (is transition registered?)
2. Permission check (does caller have role?)
3. Rule validation (guard conditions)
4. Hook execution (pre/post callbacks)

### 5. Pause Mechanism

**Guardian System**:
- Multiple pause guardians
- Immediate pause capability
- Owner-only unpause
- Contract-specific pause

**Emergency Pause**:
```solidity
function emergencyPause(string calldata reason) external
```

### 6. Oracle Safety

**Guard Mechanisms**:
- Timeout on oracle calls
- Fallback behavior on failure
- Static calls (no state changes)
- Gas limit enforcement

## Potential Risks

### 1. Hook Vulnerabilities

**Risk**: Malicious or buggy hooks could affect system

**Mitigations**:
- Gas limits on hook execution
- Continue on hook failure
- Hook registration restricted to owner
- Hooks run in try-catch blocks

### 2. Oracle Manipulation

**Risk**: Oracle data could be manipulated

**Mitigations**:
- Use trusted oracles only
- Implement timeouts
- Consider oracle reputation systems
- Add fallback validation

### 3. Role Misconfiguration

**Risk**: Incorrect role assignments

**Mitigations**:
- Careful initial setup
- Regular audits
- Event emission for all changes
- Time-locked role changes for critical roles

### 4. Upgrade Risks

**Risk**: Malicious or buggy upgrades

**Mitigations**:
- Multisig control
- Timelock delay
- Upgrade testing in testnet
- State migration validation

### 5. DoS Attacks

**Risk**: Gas-intensive operations

**Mitigations**:
- Gas limits on hooks
- Maximum hooks per transition (10)
- Efficient storage patterns
- No unbounded loops

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] All external calls protected against reentrancy
- [ ] Access control on all state-changing functions
- [ ] No integer overflow/underflow (using Solidity 0.8+)
- [ ] Event emission for all state changes
- [ ] Input validation on all public functions
- [ ] Gas optimization reviewed
- [ ] Upgrade mechanism tested
- [ ] Role assignment process documented
- [ ] Emergency procedures defined
- [ ] Oracle integration reviewed

## Best Practices

### For Workflow Designers

1. **Minimize Permissions**: Only grant roles that are absolutely necessary
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all possible state transitions
3. **Document States**: Clear documentation of each state's meaning
4. **Plan for Edge Cases**: Consider all possible paths
5. **Use Timelocks**: Add delays for critical transitions

### For Developers

1. **Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Update state before external calls
2. **Validate Inputs**: Check all parameters
3. **Emit Events**: Log all significant actions
4. **Use Safe Math**: Leverage Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include negative test cases

### For Administrators

1. **Multisig**: Use multisig for admin functions
2. **Timelock**: Add delays for sensitive operations
3. **Monitor Events**: Watch for suspicious activity
4. **Regular Audits**: Review role assignments
5. **Emergency Plan**: Have pause procedure ready

## Incident Response

### If Vulnerability Discovered

1. **Pause** - Immediately pause affected contracts
2. **Assess** - Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Notify** - Alert users and stakeholders
4. **Fix** - Develop and test fix
5. **Audit** - Security review of fix
6. **Deploy** - Upgrade with fix
7. **Post-mortem** - Document and learn

## Known Limitations

1. **Hook Failures**: Hooks that fail are skipped, not reverted
2. **Oracle Dependence**: Oracle-based rules depend on external system
3. **Gas Costs**: Complex workflows can be gas-intensive
4. **Upgrade Delay**: Timelock delays emergency fixes

## Formal Verification

Consider formal verification for:
- State transition logic
- Access control rules
- Storage layout integrity
- Upgrade safety

## External Audits

Recommended before mainnet deployment:
- Smart contract security audit
- Economic model review
- Integration testing
- Stress testing
