# StateForge

On-Chain Finite State Machine (FSM) Compiler Protocol

## Overview

StateForge is a smart contract framework that compiles finite state machines (FSM) into modular, upgradeable Solidity contracts. It provides a DSL to define workflows and a compiler that transforms state definitions into executable on-chain logic.

## Features

- **FSM DSL** → Auto-generated Solidity smart contracts
- **State Lifecycle** with on-chain validation
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for transitions
- **Pluggable Transition Guards** (ZK proof / oracle conditions / signature checks)
- **Event-Driven State Hooks** (preTransition/postTransition)
- **Upgradeable Workflows** without breaking state history

## Use Cases

- DAO lifecycles
- NFT evolution
- Multi-step DeFi strategies
- Programmable governance flows
